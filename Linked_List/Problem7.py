Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def oddEvenList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    odd = head
    even = head.next
    even_head = even

    while even and even.next:
        odd.next = even.next
        odd = odd.next

        even.next = odd.next
        even = even.next

    odd.next = even_head
    return head
