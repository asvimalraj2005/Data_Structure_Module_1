Given an integer array A of length N, considering the last element as pivot p, rearrange the elements such that for all i:

if A[i] < p then it should be present on left side of the partition
if A[i] > p then it should be present on right side of the partition
Rearrange the given array as well as return the partition index.

Note: All elements are distinct
