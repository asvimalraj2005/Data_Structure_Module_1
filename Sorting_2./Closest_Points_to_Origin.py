You are developing a feature for Zomato that helps users find the nearest restaurants to their current location. It uses GPS to determine the user's location and has access to a database of restaurants, each with its own set of coordinates in a two-dimensional space representing their geographical location on a map. The goal is to identify the "B" closest restaurants to the user, providing a quick and convenient way to choose where to eat.

Given a list of restaurant locations, denoted by A (each represented by its x and y coordinates on a map), and an integer B representing the number of closest restaurants to the user. The user's current location is assumed to be at the origin (0, 0).

Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

NOTE: Euclidean distance between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is sqrt( (x1-x2)2 + (y1-y2)2).
